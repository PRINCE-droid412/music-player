PROJECT NAME: Music Player.

My Project Idea is a Music Player

Why choose Music Player:
A Music Player is a device or application that plays audio files such MP3, through speakers or earphones, some music players can also store and play videos,  pictures, podcasts and Tv programs.
Choosing a career in Tech, I intend to work in the Media and Entertainment industry, therefore I realised Music players are universally understood and widely used,.They address a relatable need, searching for, discovering, and listening to music. Working on a music player can enhance my React.js knowledge, especially in managing state and rendering dynamic components. It will also allow me to practice building responsive designs using Tailwind CSS, Music players involve working with multimedia features like, Audio playback, interactive playback controls (Play, Pause, Volume)
