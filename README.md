PROJECT NAME: Music Player.

My Project Idea is a Music Player

Why choose Music Player:
A Music Player is a device or application that plays audio files such MP3, through speakers or earphones, some music players can also store and play videos,  pictures, podcasts and Tv programs.
Choosing a career in Tech, I intend to work in the Media and Entertainment industry, therefore I realised Music players are universally understood and widely used,.They address a relatable need, searching for, discovering, and listening to music. Working on a music player can enhance my React.js knowledge, especially in managing state and rendering dynamic components. It will also allow me to practice building responsive designs using Tailwind CSS, Music players involve working with multimedia features like, Audio playback, interactive playback controls (Play, Pause, Volume)

For this Project Music Player Projects, we will be using the Spotify Web API because it is a powerful and widely-used public API for building music-related applications. It also provides access to a vast catalog of music data and robust features for integrating playback and discovery functionality.

Phase 2: API Connection
Timeline: 2–3 Days
Key Tasks:
Register for API Access:
Choose Spotify Web API, obtain an API key or client credentials, and configure OAuth if necessary.
Create API Helper:
Write reusable functions for fetching data from the API.
Test API Calls:
Build a basic component to fetch and display JSON data as proof of concept.

Phase 3: Search Functionality
Timeline: 3–4 Days
Key Tasks:
Build the Search Component:
Create a functional search bar with a debounce mechanism to reduce unnecessary API calls.
Display Search Results:
Fetch data based on user input and map the results into a styled list (track title, artist name, album cover).
Error Handling:
Implement user-friendly error messages for failed API calls.
Add a loading spinner while data is being fetched.

Phase 4: Player Component
Timeline: 4–5 Days
Key Tasks:
Audio Player Integration:
Use react-h5-audio-player or build a custom player with <audio> tag.
Include controls for play, pause, volume adjustment, and track progress.
Track Selection:
Allow users to click on a search result to start playback.
